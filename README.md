# COE528 Object Oriented Eng Analysis and Design
This was my second Object oriented programming(OOP) course I took, this course expanded on topics I learned from my first OOP course, COE318. I dove much deeper into concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism and abstraction learning about how each concept fits 
into the design patterns of software. I also learned many newer topics, such as software unit testing, coupling and cohesion, and different types of abstraction which I applied here in the labs. My greatest takeaway from this course is learning about 
the different design patterns, this course taught me how to think like a software engineer and how to apply the most efficient and effective design pattern for any given scenario.
